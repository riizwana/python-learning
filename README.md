## 🏛️ Executive Summary
This repository serves as archival documentation of my first ever progress through the **University of Harvard CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python)** Instead of following upon exercises of each lecture, my repository focuses on attempting **algorithmic efficiency**, **error handling** and showcasing my **transition between beginner level tasks to intermediate architectures.**

This work serves solely as a foundational bridge toward my goal of specialising in **Artificial Intelligence**, where I aim to leverage Python for high-performance computational modeling!

## 🏗️ My Self-Learning Roadmap (CS50P)

| Lecture | Core Focus | Academic Syntheses & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0. Functions & Variables** | Abstraction | Implementing functional decomposition and managing global/local scopes. |
| **1. Conditionals** | Control Flow Logic | Optimizing decision-making through Boolean algebra and nested logic. |
| **2. Loops** | Iterative Processing | Analyzing time complexity during data traversal and manipulation. |
| **3. Exceptions** | Robustness | Designing defensive code architectures via try-except blocks. |
| **4. Libraries** | Modular Design | Integrating external APIs and the standard library (sys, random, statistics). |
| **5. Unit Tests** | Quality Assurance | Leveraging `pytest` to maintain code integrity and regression testing. |
| **6. File I/O** | Data Persistence | Managing non-volatile storage using CSV and binary data streaming. |
| **7. Regular Expressions** | Formal Languages | Applying complex pattern matching and verification for data cleaning. |
| **8. OOP** | Software Engineering | **Current Focus:** Transitioning to Classes, Encapsulation, and Inheritance. |

** Additional Focus: Revisiting all of CS50P.**

## 🧪 The "Dev Log"
> *"The beauty of Python lies not in its simplicity, but in its expressive power for complex logic."*

### 🧠 Current Research Interest: OOP in AI
Currently, I am navigating and re-navigating past lectures so that I am able to build from beginner level scripts into intermediate scripts to ensure my knowledge of each lecture not being superficially learnt but rather deeply understood. When understanding that in **Artificial Intelligence,** modularity is key for neural networking layers as well as mastering classes and inheritence, I learnt that those are non-negotiable to study.
### ⚡ Technical Obsessions
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** i enjoy maintaining aesthetics within my programs and it was something that I have to keep in mind to ensure clarity in whatever I program and ensuring functional cleanliness in code too.
* **The "Pythonic" Way:** From listening to Professor Malan telling students that ensuring scripts are kept in a **pythonic** way, it encourages me to be less complex with myself and to think things through more structuredly without any complications to my work. After all, the one setback to coders is overcomplicating something that was never complicated to begin with.
* **Reading Documentation:** I have found that reading python documentations can be simple if thoroughly read rather than skimmed. With my experience with studying humanities, bringing my adoration for reading and merging that with documentations made reading complex notions more enjoyable!
